# CS220AU Digital Portfolio Template

## Overview
The goal of this GitHub repository is to serves as a template for the [CS220AU](https://navigatingthedigitalworld.com/docs/cs220au) assignment. It demonstrates minimalistic approaches to:

- project management using this `README.md` file, organized under the Overview, Tasks, and Log headings
- web hosting through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- web design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- self- and peer-assessment via the `assessment.md` and `checklist.md` files

The URL for the website can be located in the sidebar, under the 'About' section. The homepage content is sourced from the `index.md` file.

### Portfolio Items
Your submitted portfolio should include the following components, along with their respective contribution to your overall mark:

1. **website** (80%): explores your chosen research question across one or multiple webpages
2. **self- and peer-assessment** (10%): utilizes the `assessment.md` file
3. **portfolio overview** (10%): provides a succinct description of your portfolio, along with a list of tasks to do (Tasks) and those already completed (Log) in this `README.md` file

Once the above items are completed, fill out the `checklist.md` file, download it, and submit on FASER.

Instructions on using this GitHub repository as a template for your assignment will be provided in class. Seek clarification if anything is unclear.
