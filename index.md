# Sense-making and the dangers of our information ecosystem
## Keywords
## Introduction
How does today’s mass communication, boosted by technology can lead to existential risks? How can we be more aware of what information are thrown at us by companies, government, and medias?
Whether in our time or in the past, our behaviour has always been influenced by external factors - the environment in which we live, the people around us, etc. Companies, medias, and government can influence our decision making and encourage us not to think for ourselves. The problem today is that since the invention of mass communication (the press and then television), and then the Internet, these external players are increasingly omnipresent in our lives, whether we are aware of it or not, and have a major influence on the decisions we make.

## I. Threats to the Information Ecosystem
### A. Disinformation
The example of COAVID 19 and the amount of shared information during this period 
article "Information and Disinformation: Social Media in the COVID-19 Crisis" https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.14036
### B. Manipulation of Public Opinion by institutions
Use of technology to influence behaviours--> Impacts political stability and democratic processes (Historical examples of manipulation of opinion leading to conflict)
Article "Social network behavior and public opinion manipulation" https://www-sciencedirect-com.uniessexlib.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S2214212621002441 
This article shows that social media has been increasingly analyzed by a lot of countries for its perceptual management and psychological manipulation, which can be used as a war tool to shape ideas, redesign society, increase sensitivity, and strengthen social responses, ultimately weakening the administration, society, military, or economy of a country.
### C. Information bubbles
Algorithms, by calculating regularities in behaviour to establish a user profile, contribute to a form of isolation for Internet users. In reality, each person accesses a different version of the Web, which locks them into a "unique and optimised" bubble.
-->Extreme polarisation of society : Information bubbles foster a sense of group identity and solidarity among like-minded individuals, making it harder for them to question their beliefs or consider alternative perspectives.

## II. Control of Information by Companies
### A. Power of the technological giants
Moderation, censorship 
### B. Surveillance and Privacy
Data collection 
### C. International challenges
Influence of disinformation on international relations + Manipulation of information for geopolitical purposes nécessité global cooperation to mitigate these risks
##  III. Impact on Existing Risks and Areas for Improvement
### A. Existing risks
Escalation of conflicts :
- **Collective misinformation can lead to mistrust** of institutions, democratic processes and other foundations of society, **resulting in social conflict, political instability and even crisis**
- the spread of information bubbles **divide communities, make constructive dialogue difficult and compromise society's ability to tackle common challenges**
- **Trust is essential for institutions, governments and social interactions to function smoothly.** If the population of a country does not trust their governement anymore, its country will no longer be properly managed, either economically or politically. Some groups within the population may also want to overthrow the government they no longer trust, leading to internal conflict and civil war.
### B. Areas for improvement
Raising awareness, corporate transparency ,International cooperation to develop common standards for information management
Sense making: be subjective, look at sources
