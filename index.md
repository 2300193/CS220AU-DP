## Introduction
Whether in our time or in the past, our behaviour has always been influenced by external factors - the environment in which we live, the people around us, etc. Companies, medias, and governments can influence our decision making and encourage us not to think for ourselves. The problem today is that since the invention of mass communication (the press, television), and then the Internet, these external players are increasingly omnipresent in our lives, whether we are aware of it or not, and have a major influence on the decisions we make. 

So we can then ask ourselves : How does today’s mass communication, boosted by technology leads to existential risks? How can we be more aware of what information are thrown at us by companies, governments, and medias?

It is essential to inform ourselves about the informational dangers inherent in our hyper-connected society, such as disinformation or the control of algorithms by major institutions, and the resulting polarisation of people. We can also look at the real power wielded by the big companies, what they censor, what they encourage and how technology is used to control the mind of people. And finally, all this might help us understand how these actions can lead to humanity's downfall, by boosting internal conflicts or disputes between countries, and motivate us to develop our awareness of these issues so that we can better position ourselves in our society and be mindful of our choices.

## I. Threats to the Information Ecosystem
### A. Disinformation
The example of COAVID 19 and the amount of shared information during this period 
article "Information and Disinformation: Social Media in the COVID-19 Crisis" https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.14036
### B. Manipulation of Public Opinion by institutions
Use of technology to influence behaviours--> Impacts political stability and democratic processes (Historical examples of manipulation of opinion leading to conflict).

Article "Social network behavior and public opinion manipulation" https://www-sciencedirect-com.uniessexlib.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S2214212621002441 
This article shows that social media has been increasingly analyzed by a lot of countries for its perceptual management and psychological manipulation, which can be used as a war tool to shape ideas, redesign society, increase sensitivity, and strengthen social responses, ultimately weakening the administration, society, military, or economy of a country.

Another example in our pop-culture : the movie "don't look up" on Netflix.
### C. Information bubbles
Algorithms, by calculating regularities in behaviour to establish a user profile, contribute to a form of isolation for Internet users. In reality, each person accesses a different version of the Web, which locks them into a "unique and optimised" bubble.
-->Extreme polarisation of society : Information bubbles foster a sense of group identity and solidarity among like-minded individuals, making it harder for them to question their beliefs or consider alternative perspectives.

## II. Control of Information by Companies
### A. Power of the technological giants
Social networks, search engines, and messaging services are all owned by technological giants.
They have content moderation standards in place to filter material published on their platforms. They can eliminate content that is violent, hateful, or violates the platform's regulations. 
In several occasions, companies have been criticised for dubious censorship policies. For example, deleting certain political content, banning accounts, or limiting the exposure of specific speakers might be interpreted as acts of censorship, raising discussions over free expression.
These algorithms decide what information is shown to a user and have the ability to affect the media agenda by favouring certain issues over others. In this sense, technology behemoths have an impact on the visibility of specific content as well as the moulding of public opinion, which can create as we saw before information bubbles.
### B. Surveillance and Privacy
Data collection on social media by companies, or in our daily lives with smart objects.

Another examples : social commerce and how it affects our privacy.
The article "Investigating online social media users’ behaviors for social commerce recommendations" indicates "With business concepts of online shopping and social networks, social commerce connects sellers, and consumers span over websites and social platforms".
https://www-sciencedirect-com.uniessexlib.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0160791X21001305?via%3Dihub 

Social commerce platforms collect extensive user data, including browsing history, preferences, and interactions, to create detailed profiles for targeted advertising. Then, they can share this data with third-party advertisers that could increase the risk of unauthorized access or misuse. Some companies use tracking technologies, like cookies and pixels to monitor user behavior and analyse it to show more pertinent and personnalised information to eacher user.Social commerce, by facilitating payments online, can encore more people to pay on social platform, which could be dangerous if those payment informations are revealed : in the event of a data breach, users' financial details may be compromised, leading to potential fraud or identity theft. 

### C. International challenges
Influence of disinformation on international relations + Manipulation of information for geopolitical purposes nécessité global cooperation to mitigate these risks
##  III. Impact on Existing Risks and Areas for Improvement
### A. Existing risks
Escalation of conflicts :
- **Collective misinformation can lead to mistrust** of institutions, democratic processes and other foundations of society, **resulting in social conflict, political instability and even crisis**
- the spread of information bubbles **divide communities, make constructive dialogue difficult and compromise society's ability to tackle common challenges**
- **Trust is essential for institutions, governments and social interactions to function smoothly.** If the population of a country does not trust their governement anymore, its country will no longer be properly managed, either economically or politically. Some groups within the population may also want to overthrow the government they no longer trust, leading to internal conflict and civil war.
### B. Areas for improvement and sense-making
Raising awareness, corporate transparency ,International cooperation to develop common standards for information management
Sense making: be subjective, look at sources
